# GitHub Sherlock

Interrogate your GitHub resources with the help of the World's greatest
detectives: Steampipe + Sherlock. GitHub Sherlock allows you to perform 
deep analysis of your GitHub organization and repo configuration and test 
them against operations & security best practices.

## Quick start

1) Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```shell
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe

steampipe -v 
steampipe version 0.5.1
```

2) Install the GitHub plugin:
```shell
steampipe plugin install github
```

3) Configure your GitHub creds: [Instructions](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github#credentials)

`vi ~/.steampipe/config/github.spc`
```hcl
connection "github" {
  plugin = "github"
  token  = "111222333444555666777888999aaabbbcccddde"
}
```

4) Clone this repo and step into the directory:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:turbot/steampipe-mod-github-sherlock
cd steampipe-mod-github-sherlock
```

5) Run the checks:
```shell
steampipe check all
```

You can also run a specific controls by name:
```shell
steampipe check control.public_repo_code_of_conduct_added
```

## Current Sherlock Checks
- [GitHub Organizations best practices](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/github_sherlock/controls/benchmark.org_best_practices)
- [Private Repo best practices](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/github_sherlock/controls/benchmark.private_repo_best_practices)

- [Issue best practices](https://hub.steampipe.io/mods/turbot/github_sherlock/controls/benchmark.issue_best_practices)

**Use introspection to view the available controls:**:
```
steampipe query "select resource_name from steampipe_control;"
```

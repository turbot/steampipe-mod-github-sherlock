# GitHub Sherlock Mod for Steampipe

Interrogate your GitHub resources with the help of the World's greatest
detectives: Steampipe + Sherlock. GitHub Sherlock allows you to perform
deep analysis of your GitHub organization and repo configuration and test
them against operations & security best practices.

Run checks in a dashboard:

## Getting started

### Installation

Download and install Steampipe (https://steampipe.io/downloads). Or use Brew:

```sh
brew tap turbot/tap
brew install steampipe
```

Install the GitHub plugin with [Steampipe](https://steampipe.io):

```sh
steampipe plugin install github
```

Clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turbot/steampipe-mod-github-sherlock.git
cd steampipe-mod-github-sherlock
```

### Usage

Start your dashboard server to get started:

```sh
steampipe dashboard
```

By default, the dashboard interface will then be launched in a new browser
window at http://localhost:9194. From here, you can run benchmarks by
selecting one or searching for a specific one.

Instead of running benchmarks in a dashboard, you can also run them within your
terminal with the `steampipe check` command:

Run all benchmarks:

```sh
steampipe check all
```

Run a single benchmark:

```sh
steampipe check benchmark.org_best_practices
```

Run a specific control:

```sh
steampipe check control.org_two_factor_required
```

Different output formats are also available, for more information please see
[Output Formats](https://steampipe.io/docs/reference/cli/check#output-formats).

### Credentials

This mod uses the credentials configured in the [Steampipe GitHub plugin](https://hub.steampipe.io/plugins/turbot/github).

### Configuration

No extra configuration is required.
